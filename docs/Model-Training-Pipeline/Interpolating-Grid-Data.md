The datasets downloaded from Copernicus Marine are defined in the [Equirectangular projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equirectangular_projection), meaning that the data is defined on a regularly spaced grid over latitude-longitude coordinates. There are two reasons why we want to interpolate this data to a new grid. Firstly because the the **Physics** and **Biogeochemistry** datasets are defined over different grids. We have to interpolate the datasets to the same grids in order to join them together. Secondly, grids in the Equirectangular Projection have large distortions near the poles. This is especially a problem for our use-case, since a large portion of fishing occurs in the arctic region, where both distances and directions are very distorted. 

All geographic projections introduce distortions in some way. Different projections are designed to preserve different properties, such as distances ([equidistant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azimuthal_equidistant_projection)), areas ([equal-area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-area_projection)) and shapes ([conformal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_map_projection)), but no single projection can preserve all once. Projections are usually designed to minimize distortions in an chosen area. When we are working within a relatively small geopgraphical area, the specific type of projection has little effect on the results. It is much more important to use a projection that is centered on the geographical domain of the data. The equirectangular projection is least distorted near the equator

The figure above compares two grids defined in different coordinate systems. The <span style="color:cyan">cyan</span> grid is defined in the Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection and the <span style="color:magenta">magenta</span> is grid defined in the Equirectangular projection. Both grids are centered on the same coordinates: (75°N, 20°E), and cover approximately the same area. The important difference is that for the first, grid both the projection and the grid are centered on same coordinates, meaning that we have defined the grid in the area where the projection has the least ditortion.

We can clearly see that the second grid is much more distorted than the first one. 
The shape of the grid is very warped and the area of the largest grid cell is over three times that of the smallest cell in the second grid! In the first grid the largest cell is only 0.23% larger than the smallest.
