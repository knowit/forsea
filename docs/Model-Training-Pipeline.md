## Catch Data
Catch data is in the form of a parquet file downloaded from Azure Blob Storage.
Each row corresponds to a catch activity reported to the DCA part of [ERS](https://www.fiskeridir.no/Tall-og-analyse/AApne-data/elektronisk-rapportering-ers). The rows contain data about the vessel that reported the catch, the round weights of the species that were caught, and the time, position, speed and course of the vessel between the start and stop time of the catch activity.
